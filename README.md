# HareAIris

> HareAIris is a software bridge connecting RabbitMQ to the OpenAI API. It is designed to help developers integrate message-driven applications with advanced AI capabilities.

> The name "HareAIris" is a creative blend of "AI," "Iris," and "Hare." In mythology, Iris is the Greek goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, symbolizing communication and connection. The "Hare" element represents speed and agility, attributes often associated with rabbits. Together, "HareAIris" signifies a swift and efficient messenger that bridges the gap between RabbitMQ and OpenAI, embodying the project's core functionality.
